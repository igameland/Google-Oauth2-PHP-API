Google-Oauth2-PHP-API
=====================

Couldn't find a really good tutorial online, the example in Google APIs Client Library 
simply don't work and all examples just push you to their  g+... 

The example is fairly simple, you only need two files
redirect.php //will echo out the auth url to google

calback.php //display the auth user's email and profile.
